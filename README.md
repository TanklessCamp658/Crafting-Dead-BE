# Crafting Dead BE

Starting out as a mod for Minecraft 1.5, Crafting Dead has been around for many years now. It was built on F3RULLO's Gun Mod, one of the first gun mods on the Minecraft scene and has been growing ever since, constantly being enhanced with more content and features.

Crafting Dead adds in a multitude of zombies and guns, along with cosmetics and medical supplies. The guns are fully customisable with attachments and paints; they are competitive ready with accurate hit detection, latency compensation and recoil. Medical supplies include first aid kits, adrenaline and bandages enabling you to quickly escape, attack and recover from combat situations.

Now me, TanklessCamp658, a big fan of Crafting Dead modpacks, made this Crating Dead available for everyone who use Minecraft Bedrock Edition
